People are welcoming.\n\nThe food is in the style of fine dining. But not very expensive compared to other fine dining options in Sydney. For a meal, it will cost around $50 with desserts. The food is tasty and there is not a big menu to select from."

Seating is available inside or outside on the verandah area. I recommend outdoor seating during summer time to take in the picturesque views towards Botany Bay. Exceptional sunset views are best paired with a drink and bar nibbles. Food is always exceptional, whether it be for small or large events. A thoughtfully curated wine list to suit all budgets."

A tiny serve of cheese (2 small pieces) with crackers and a few raisins was certainly not worth $16. Minimalistic to be kind. Mean otherwise. The quality of the food was fine, the service average, the ambience and view good, though you can't see the view when seated. I get the impression it is intended for people on expense accounts."

The Lounge offers exceptional service and food quality beyond what is seen in the rest of campus. Located on the top of the main library, not only is this hidden away from the general student population, but the additional balcony offers exception views of the campus below and the city in the distance.\n\nThe lounge offers a selection of a la carte options with dessert, wine and tea to come with. With various menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a late closing time of 10 pm, this place would be great for any occasion."

However, the aura of this place was quite uplifting; with the  smell indicating the home made aspect of the meals .\nI opted for the classic choice of ‚ÄúHainanese Chicken Tasty Rice - $16.5 ‚Äù. The order arrived quite quickly. I was slightly disappointed with the portions to be honest but that was quickly resolved upon tasting. One orders this meal when they require a hearty meal, which luckily was the case here. The chicken is boiled and steamed to perfection. Accompanied by well seasoned scallions, this dish is just a great comfort food. The flavours blend together creating a tasty concoction. Evidently, a mix of chicken and rice should normally be quite good; this place turns it into a delectable meal.\n\nI would however recommend having a more balanced marination of the chicken as it does at parts lack flavour. Overall, I was quite pleased with this experience.\n\nAs for the place itself; the indoor seating area feels quite crammed and gets very hot on certain days. The outdoor seating is lovely though and balances out the weather on a hot day such as the day of this review. I was delighted to have this option."

Another academic Feed Punch saw the Feed Punchers landing at Southern Wok, located in the mid to upper campus of UNSW.\n\n-The roast duck was roasted to perfection with great crispy skin, maintaining a sweet and salty dark-soy flavour. Sided with a moist steamed bok choy, which helped balance the saltiness.\n\n-The Shanghai noodles were extremely diverse, featuring beef, prawns and chicken. There was a strong fish sauce taste and  an addition of bok choy and crunchy onion. A bit of extra spice would have empowered this dish greatly.\n\n-The Hainan chicken was poached to perfection. It was extremely soft and delicate in the mouth, giving off simple but effective flavours of ginger, garlic and chicken broth.\n\n-The Shandong chicken was a little light on seasoning and flavour, but the chicken was yet again, cooked to perfection. Also served with bok choy and rice, alike the other dishes.\n\n-The fried rice had chicken in it which was quite unique, differing from classic pork fried rices. It had nice tastes of spring onion, egg and subtle flavours from the prawns.\n\n-The BBQ pork was tender but lacked in flavour. The one served with rice had a slight salty-soy-chilli taste, however, the one served with noodles was extremely flavourless.\n\nOverall, this was a nice, quick, academic feed, which offered some well cooked meals, just slightly falling short of flavour in some areas. Thanks Southern Wok!"

Most recently, however, the food quantities per order have been decreasing, specifically for take-away orders. There is too much rice and not enough meat.\nThe restaurant still earns 4 stars, although heavily debated, as I recently found two hairs in my meal.\nI recommend the Pad See Eew.

The soup was delicious, rumoured to be so addictive there could've been drugs in there we joked. But it was all love and authenticity. I order mine just egg noodles and soy chicken.

Make sure you slurp every drop of your soup because I will guarantee you would be asking for more. The store is open throughout the year but close during summer university break."

You can tell they work really hard and genuinely care about what they do which just makes the vibe even better.\n\nThe coffee is always spot on. Smooth, strong, and just consistently good. It‚Äôs the kind of place where you can rely on your order being perfect every time. Their food is just as good. I always recommend the bacon and egg roll. And the huge muffins which are the best afternoon snack. You honestly can‚Äôt go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nI come here pretty much every day. It‚Äôs cozy, welcoming, and reminds me of home.

Not only that after when asked what dressing, i asked for lemon, She gave me two options, couldnt understead what she was saying but I asked her many times to just put one of them on. But apparently I need to say the specific name of the dressing for her to actuall give me the salad, that I dont understand what she is saying, and im in a rush so I couldnt care less what dressing you use. Every other time before I just got told lemon was a dressing, so thats all I asked for. If youre gonna be a stubborn little Sh!t because of some dressing names, dont work. I shouldnt have to ask just put any dressing 5 times for me to get my food, and I dont understand how stingy you guys are. In total i got 3 pieces of beef in my salad. And 60% of my bowl is rocket leaf. Thank you guys very much.\n\nEdit in total: 3 small slices of chicken from ur buffalo sald. 2 little slices of of beef and some beef scraps from the beef salad.
